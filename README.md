# Python Voice Assistant Project

Developed as part of the LetsGrowMore internship program, this Python Voice Assistant project utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion to create a personalized assistant for various tasks. The assistant enhances user interaction by interpreting voice commands and performing actions accordingly.

## Project Overview

Voice assistants have revolutionized user interaction with technology, enabling hands-free control and automation of tasks. This project focuses on implementing a basic voice assistant using Python, capable of understanding and responding to user queries through voice input.

### Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Captures user commands from microphone input.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Provides responses and information through spoken output.
- **Basic Command Handling**: Implements functionalities like greetings, time inquiries, and web searches (implementation required).
- **Personalization**: Customize assistant capabilities to fit specific user needs and preferences.

### Libraries Used

- `speech_recognition`: Enables audio capture and recognition from microphone input.
- `pyttsx3`: Converts text responses into spoken output for user interaction.
